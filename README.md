The script will zip all the folders that are given and then will zip all the zipped files into a master zip

The options file contains all the options, this is where you can give what folders to zip. There are other options that you can modify. These are self explanatory.

To upload files, you need to run server script on the computer you want to transfer the files into and change the server_config file to include the IP and Port and where you want the file to be stored.

Then in the options file give it the ipaddress of the server and the port like this `1.1.1.1:5000`.
